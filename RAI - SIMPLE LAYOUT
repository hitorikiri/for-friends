    <!------- Description ------->
    <p>
        <h1>Description</h1>
            <p>Ji-Eun or the famous Flamingo is a free-spirited woman. She's known for being bubbly and sweet yet graceful and ladylike. Flam is an easy-going social butterfly that loves and focuses on her hobbies everyday. Even though she's idolized by a lot of people, Flam hides the fact that she's stubborn, impatient, and unsophisticated to the public but her work environment and family. Flam is an open person as well, she enjoys sharing and telling stories to people, unless it's about her past.</p>
            
            <p>Due of her trauma and terrible efforts of her therapist, Flam developed a meaner ego to protect herself, specifically from men. Flam doesn't like to talk, spend time with, or even respect men. She would do her best to never include another guy in her personal life anymore.</p>
    </p>

    <!------- History/Background ------->
    <h1>History/Background</h1>
    
    <p>One of the scientists offered an idea to the table; "What if we experiment on recreating a whole family in the form of Glossy?" and everyone instantly agreed. One of them was also desperate to return dead celebrities, so the team made the well-known Ryuk Ji-Eun or Flamingo (her artist name) - along with her family.</p>
    
    <p>Flam was naturally "born" to be talented as she should be. Flam was able to sing and play a few instruments. She used the opportunity to make money by entertaining the scientists and Glossies. Flam was also assisted on her creative skills and was accompanied by a scientist woman ever since her creation date, making Flam heavily influenced by her and (secretly) sees her as a mother figure. </p>
    
    <p>The experiment went surprisingly well. Every part of the family member could feel related to each other and function as a perfect household. The team was relieved and celebrated their success without knowing they would repeat a horrible unwritten history. However, 8 months later, the peaceful dynamic and image of her perfect family was torn apart. A lot of scientists and Glossies observed tense situations between them. Some even witnessed physical and verbal abuse between the father and the children, including Flam. More conflict arose and the family's mental health declined, causing Flam's younger brother to almost commit homicide to their father. Many thought that the incident occured due to faults in the program, while the others thought that Flam's family just works like that because of their established personality.</p>
    
    <p>Flam's father and brother was instantly separated from the family and was contained in a safe place. Meanwhile Flam, her mother, and her older sister (Angelica) had to go through therapy for several months. 12 months later, Flam and Angelica was liberated to the outside world. Flam then commited to her artistic ambitions and became famous without any struggles or stress. Now, Flam is currently simultaneously working as a famous singer and influencer. Flam lives alone in a modern condo far away from the lab. Her main goal is to create a band.</p>

    <!------- Current lifestyle ------->
    <h1>Current lifestyle</h1> 
    <p>Although Flam climbed the stair of fame easily, Flam is still struggling to keep her place. Flam lives as a busy bee; coming up with new gigs, managing her time to perform across the country, promoting great brands, leaving her free time to arrange a meeting with both music and marketing agency, and also entertaining her audiences. Flam constantly has to keep up with the viewer's expectations on her, but not to the point she changes herself completely, like how Flam enjoys making R&B and pop songs. She also had to be up to date with popular products, topics, or anything that she could use to make money. Regardless of her hard work and effort, Flam is not - or will never be - proud of herself considering her sister is more successful.</p>
    
    <p>Whenever Flam has a vacation or a little bit of free time from world's hunger for entertainment, Flam barely goes back to the lab to visit her family. She avoids meeting any of them and will always try to run away whenever she's forced to do so. Instead of checking on her family, she usually does nothing to socialize. She doesn't have a lot of friends other than co-workers, so she spent her me time by napping and scrolling through social media.</p>

    <!------- Relationships ------->
    <h1>Relationships</h1>
    
        <a href="https://toyhou.se/7939557.angelica">Angelica</a> : Flam's current status with Angelica is normal, but could be better.
    <br>
        <a href="#">Mother</a> : Flam despises her mother a lot. She doesn't understand how she could keep up with a controlling and abusive husband, and will never even protect or be on the children's sides when they're in trouble. It's also exhausting to be with her because she puts up pressure of great expectations on Flam too, whether it's about her career, behavior, or social life. Flam feels like she could never reach her standards and it annoys her. Flam's current status with her mother is terrible. Flam has already cut off their connection.
